# Working-with-Julia

This is a collection of projects/assignment in which I showcase my practices of Julia programming. As this collection will largely consists of various projects and not one full mega project, there will be many smaller folders, each for a specific assignment I do. Credits to instructors/ sources will be given accordingly, either in a readme or within the notebooks.
